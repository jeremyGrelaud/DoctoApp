        <h1>Purpose of our project</h1>
        <p>
            This app aims to help the elderly people managing their health.
            For that we will provide them an interactive list of their medication
            with timed notifications to avoid a poor medical treatment. The app will
            also allow them to see and manage their doctors appointement and lastly a
            tutor/guardian system will be implemented in the app. Therefore a person 
            responsible of the elderly user would be alerted by an email in case of a 
            forgotten dosing time.
        </p>

        <h2>Let's wrap up the different functionalities of our program :</h2>
        <h3>Mandatory requirements : </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Being able to confirm that we took our medication</li>
            <li>Consulting our treatment list</li>
            <li>Being alerted by a notification at the right dosing time</li>
            <li>Producing a report of the treatment history for the caregiver</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Additional requirements : </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Login and register</li>
            <li>Adding treaments to our treatment list</li>
            <li>Choosing a tutor by giving his email adress</li>
            <li>Alerting the tutor/guardian in a short time if we didn't take our medication</li>
            <li>Making a list of our future doctor appointments and seing the next one in the home page</li>
        </ul>

        <br><br>
        <p>
            We will now talk a little bit about the different existing apps and website that we saw during our researchs.
            And then we will tackle the main challenges that we will have to face during the implementation of our app and hwo we plan to overcome them.

            First let's talk about the app Medicine time!
            It had a functionality of notification for treaments just like what we are gonna implement.
            And their design of notification was similar to what we had in mind.
            And the idea to add the frequency of the treaments and the remaining days is a good idea.
        </p>

        <br><br>
        <p>
            ZocDoc is an application that allow you to take medical appointments online. This application will simplifate all your schedules with a friendly user design.
        </p>
        
        <br>
        <img src="img_web/Screenshot_Zocdoc.webp" alt="image of ZocDac" style="width:20%">

        <br><br>
        <p>
            Heal is an application where you can contact doctor from your house and take an appointement if needed. It is very famous in the USA.
        </p>

        <img src="img_web/Heal2.PNG" alt="image of heal" style="width:20%">

        <br><br>
        <p>
            Finaly, there is the french equivalent of Heal called Doctolib. Basiclly the same functionalities, Doctolib allow the user to take appointement with 
            all doctors register on the app.
        </p>

        <h2>Challeges & how to do it</h2>
        <p>
            One of the main challenges will be to manage the schedule of the customer. The schedule have to be easy to change for the user and we have to connect
            it to the guardian. So we have to create a simple and clear database with good interactions.
            <br>
            We choose to create this project in java, because we will need to use the object oriented method. As all the members of the group learned java in class
            this is a good choice.
        </p>

        <img src="img_web/mindmap.png" alt="mindmap of our project" style="width:90%">
        <p>Here's our mindmap. We created it in first to have an overview of the project. 
            With that we can know what we have to do, how we will do it and of course all the deadlines we have.
            We also can see that we defined our requierments and the audiance for the app.
