        <h1>Purpose of our project</h1>
        <p>This app aims to help the elderly people managing their health.
            For that we will provide them an interactive list of their medication
            with timed notifications to avoid a poor medical treatment. The app will
            also allow them to see and manage their doctors appointement and lastly a
            tutor/guardian system will be implemented in the app. Therefore a person 
            responsible of the elderly user would be alerted by sms in case of a 
            forgotten dosing time.

            <br><br>
            Rest of documentation : ...
            Examples of other websites/apps already existing
            How we will implements functionalities/what could be the challenges...

            We saw the app Medicine time!
            It had a functionality of notification for treaments just like what we are gonna implement.
            And their design of notification was similar to what we had in mind.
            And the idea to add the frequency of the treaments and the remaining days is a good idea.
